= crs517 ex61 via annotations

$ find . -name \*.xml
$ # No XML files here!

Done with annotations only.
Put together with:

* The original Course 517 version of Ex6.1 (as of 2019).
* Help from  https://websystique.com/springmvc/spring-4-mvc-helloworld-tutorial-annotation-javaconfig-full-example[].
* Help from Sharon Doyle.

Converted to use Maven (mainly so I can use my existing Wildfly deploy setup).
